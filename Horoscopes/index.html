                 <p id="first-info"> <span class='firstInfoSpan'>The horoscope</span> serves as a stylized map of the heavens over a specific location at a particular moment in time. In most
                applications the perspective is geocentric (heliocentric astrology being one exception). The positions of the actual
                planets (including Sun and Moon) are placed in the chart, hose of purely calculated factors such as the lunar nodes, the
                house cusps including the midheaven and the ascendant, zodiac signs, fixed stars and the lots. Angular relationships
                between the planets themselves and other points, called aspects, are typi, including weakness. <br> <span class='firstInfoSpan'>The Zodiac</span> or "circle of animals" is a zone or belt in space projected onto the celestial sphere through
                which, from our viewpoint,
                the planets move. A symbolic geometric construction around 16 degrees wide, it is divided into 12 signs, each of 30
                degrees longitude (making 360 degrees, a full circle), with the ecliptic, the apparent path of the Sun, as its middle
                line.[15] The tropical zodiac used by most Western astrologers has its beginning at the exact moment that the Sun
                crosses the celestial equator and enters the zodiacal sign of Aries. Some Western astrologers use the sidereal zodiac
                favored by Indian ("Jyotish") astrologers, which is based more closely on actual positions of constellations in the
                heavens, as opposed to the tropical zodiac, which is a moveable format based on the seasons.</p>
